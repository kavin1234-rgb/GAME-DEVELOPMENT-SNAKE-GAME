**This C++ program implements a simple, text-based Snake game where the player controls a snake to eat fruit and avoid colliding with itself. The game is played in a terminal window, with the snake represented by an 'O' for the head and 'o' for the tail, and the fruit shown as an asterisk ('*'). The game area is bordered by hash ('#') symbols, and the snake can move in four directions (left, right, up, and down) based on user input. The player gains points by eating fruit, which spawns at random positions, and the snake grows longer as the player progresses. The game continues until the snake collides with itself, at which point the game ends, and the final score is displayed. The code allows for a simple, yet functional, gameplay experience, making it an ideal project for learning C++ concepts such as loops, arrays, conditionals, and user input handling. It also provides a foundation for text-based games or simple simulation projects and can serve as a fun, retro-style game for casual entertainment. While it could be expanded with features like improved graphics, non-blocking input, and high score tracking, itâ€™s an excellent starting point for developers looking to practice basic game development.**
